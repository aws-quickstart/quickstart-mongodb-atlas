== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].

*Q.* Do I need to run the RegisterMongoDBResource step each time?

*A.* You only need to run this step once per region.

*Q.* What does the RegisterMongoDBResource step do?

*A.* This steps registers each of the MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation Resource Types. This is a standard requirement from CloudFormation. Please refer to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html[AWS Custom Resource^] documentation.

== Troubleshooting

Errors can typlically be resolved by inspecting the CloudFormation event logs or the CloudWatch logs created by the MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation Resources.

If a stack fails to deploy, check the Events tab. If the error occurs for one of the MongoDB Atlas resources, say for example MongoDB::Atlas::Cluster, then you will find a corresponding AWS CloudWatch Log Group called "mongodb-atlas-cluster-logs". Find this group and check the latest log stream entry to find the cause of the issue.
