This Quick Start provides multiple deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new complete MongoDB Atlas environment within AWS consisting of the a project, cluster, and more.

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option peers {partner-product-short-name} with a brand new AWS Virtual Private Cloud.

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC*. This option peers {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

Each option also provisions an AWS IAM Role and corresponding MongoDB Database User to use for secure connections to your MongoDB Atlas Cluster.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure database cluster tier settings, and other {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
