Use this Quick Start to automatically set up the following {partner-product-short-name} environment on AWS:

* A {partner-product-short-name} cluster consisting of a minimum three-node replica set, distributed across availability zones in the AWS region of your choice, in a new virtual private cloud (VPC).

* A {partner-product-short-name} project with an optional VPC network peering connection to a new or existing VPC on AWS to allow secure outbound internet connectivity to your Atlas cluster.

* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance role with fine-grained permissions for access to AWS services and {partner-product-short-name} necessary for the deployment process.

* A MongoDB database user that assumes the newly created AWS IAM role with read and write access to the {partner-product-short-name} cluster, along with a {partner-product-short-name} IP access list entry for that database user to restrict access to only authenticated users.


This Quick Start provisions complete MongoDB Atlas deployments through CloudFormation using official MongoDB Atlas AWS CloudFormation Resource Types.
