==== Prepare your AWS account

This quick start uses the MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation Resource Types and automatically registers in the AWS region you wish to launch the quick start. Once run, you can safely skip this step on additional deployments in each region by setting the ```RegisterMongoDBResources``` parameter to **No**.

==== Prepare your {partner-company-name} account

A MongoDB Atlas programmatic API key must be generated with the appropriate permissions and network access entries so that CloudFormation is able to successfully authentication to the MongoDB Cloud.  The https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-programmatic-access[manage programmatic access^] topic in the MongoDB Atlas documentation contains the most up-to-date instructions for creating and managing API Keys.
